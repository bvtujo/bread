I know, I didn't think it would work either. 
This recipe is adapted from [this one at TheSpruceEats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/recipes-using-sourdough-starter-1446644) with some major modifications. Namely, I didn't actually have vegetable oil, and I got spooked by a comment on the recipe that claimed it was very dry. 

Anyway, here's a picture of how it turned out:

## Ingredients
### Streusel Topping
* 1/2 c flour
* 1/4 c sugar
* 1/8 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 c butter

### Cake
* 1 c (160g) sourdough starter, 100% hydration, at peak activity
* 1/3 cup mayonnaise
* 1/3 cup ricotta
* 1 egg
* 80 g all purpose flour
* 25 g Hi-Maize resistant starch
* 3/4 c sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp cardamom
* 1/4 tsp allspice

## Steps
1. Make the streusel by combining the dry ingredients in a bowl, then cubing the butter and rubbing it together until it forms a crumb-like consistency (or mess it up like I did by melting the butter entirely, resulting in a paste).

Set aside for later use. 
2. Place sourdough starter in a bowl and add all remaining ingredients. Stir or beat together with stand mixer until combined. 
3. Preheat oven to 375 F.
4. Butter and flour an 8 or 9 inch cake pan. Pour batter into pan and smooth to edges. Top with streusel crumb topping.
5. Let cake rise for about 30 minutes in a warm place. 
6. Bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, or until the center is approximately 210 degrees F. 
7. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
