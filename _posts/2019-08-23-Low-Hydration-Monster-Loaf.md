This is a continuing experiment in low-hydration sourdough. Turns out that
by being careful and methodical in your mixing and hydration, you can get 
beautiful open crumb even from a 65% or lower loaf. The proof is in the pictures:

That's an earlier loaf, but it's got amazing structure for so little hydration. Plenty
of big tunnels and a nice toothy crumb. 

For this recipe, I wanted to see how big a loaf the dutch oven could hold, so I divided
the final dough into one comically large one (about 750g flour) and one normal sized one
(about 500g flour). 

## Baker's Percentages
### Total Flour: 1250 g
### Hydration: 65%

| Ingredient  | %   | mass (g) |
|------------+-----+---------|
| White Flour | 87% | 1087.5   |
| WW Flour    | 5%  | 62.5     |
| Hi-Maize    | 8%  | 100      |
| Starter (100% Hydration) | 20% | 250 |
| Salt        | 2%  | 25       |
| Water       | 61.5% | 768.8 |
**Pre-inoculation Hydration: 61%**
**Overall Hydration: 65%**

## Steps
I did this loaf over two days. Here's the timeline:
* 9:00 pm: Premix and refrigerate. All ingredients except starter go into a bowl
and get mixed together for 10 minutes or so before a long autolyse overnight. 
* 11:00 pm: Remove from fridge so dough can spend time at room temp and relax.
* 7:00 am (next day): Inoculate with starter. Spread starter over the dough, dimple
it in, and mix by hand, rolling the dough around the bowl for about 15 minutes to 
ensure ample dispersion. 
* 8:30 am: Stretch & fold number 1.
* 9:15 am: Stretch & fold number 2.
* 11:00 am: Stretch and fold number 3. 
* 11:30 am: Stretch and fold, then divide and pre-shape into balls. 
* 12:00 pm: Shape into final boule shapes and let rest in bowls prepared with 
well-floured dish towels. 
* 2:00 pm: Preheat to 500 with dutch oven inside. 
* 2:40 pm: Bake! Drop prepared loaf into dutch oven and score. 
* 3:00 pm: Remove top of dutch oven. Decrease heat to 450 and bake for 15 more minutes, or until the top looks nice and dark.
