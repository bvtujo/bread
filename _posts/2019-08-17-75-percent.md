# A 75% Hydration Loaf
## 2019-08-17
### Ingredients
* 380g leaven
* 92 g hi-maize
* 860 g unbleached ap flour
* 620g water
* 50g water
* sea salt

*Total hydration:* 620+50+190 / (92 + 850 + 190) = *75%*

### Baking
oven at 450 degrees
one loaf in dutch oven
one loaf in cast iron
25 minutes lid on
12 minutes lid off

### Result
A difficult-to-shape loaf. Unsure if this was actually 75% hydration or my math was wrong. It was early in the morning and I made some dumb mistakes mixing in the leaven (added all 400g instead of just 200, poured out 100g water/leaven mixture after adding in 700g water). The dough is supposed to be 77% hydration and maybe I achieved that in one of the leaves, but it's unclear. 

Crumb is dense. Has a definite sour flavor. Too difficult to shape, though. Maybe add gluten or give longer in the stand mixer before strech and folds
